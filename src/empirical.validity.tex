\section{Generalizability and Validity}

\subsection{Scale of experiment}

% small number of participants

\subsection{Selection of subjects}

% We were only concerned with Firefox users. These are probably
% not representative for Urørt users.

\subsection{Technical seeding}

% The installation process was somewhat complicated. This means
% that the most technically knowledgeable people are those
% which answered our posttests.

\subsection{Motive for participation}

% The people who want to participate in such an elaborate study is
% probably fairly interested in Urørt. They are experienced Urørt users
% and are therefore not representative of the Urørt population.

\subsection{Implications}

% This has consequences for the validity of our study. We can not generalize
% back to Urørt users in general.
