\section{Generalizability and Validity}

There is a few factors which have to be taken into consideration when reading
the conclusions of our empirical study which we've recently discussed.

\subsection{Scale of experiment}

As described in 
\sectionref{empirical.results}
we experienced quite high non-accomplishment rates in our study. This meant
that we only had 25 respondents to our posttest. This number were four times
lower than what we had expected.%
\sidenote{
  See
  \sectionref{empirical.methodology.subjects}
  for details about our participation expectations.
}

\subsection{Selection of subjects}

We were only
concerned with respondents which were users of the Firefox web browser
due to the technical solution we had selected for our prototype.
There is a strong possiblity for Firefox users not beeing representative for
the \urort{} populace. Installing a custom web browser%
\sidenote{
  Unless one are using an operating system like \abbr{GNU}/Linux where
  often Firefox is the default web browser.
}
requires some technical knowledge. One could therefore argue that Firefox
users are more technical on average compared to people which use their
operating system's default browser.

\subsection{Technical seeding}

% The installation process was somewhat complicated. This means
% that the most technically knowledgeable people are those
% which answered our posttests.

\subsection{Motive for participation}

% The people who want to participate in such an elaborate study is
% probably fairly interested in Urørt. They are experienced Urørt users
% and are therefore not representative of the Urørt population.

\subsection{Implications}

The factors we've listed are all limitiations of our study which could
interfere with the validity of our findings.
In light of these limitations we can not generalize
our results to the general \urort{} populace. The work we've
provided is early research on activity streams and prototyping with
Greasemonkey, and should be considered as preliminary indications of the
usefulness of such solutions.
