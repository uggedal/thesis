\chapter{Introduction}

% The point of the introduction is to answer: what is this thesis about?
% Explain this in four steps by:
%
%   * Why you have chosen this topic rather than any other. Examples:
%       - has been neglected
%       - much discussed but not properly and fully
%   * Why this topic interests you.
%   * The kind of research approach or academic disciple you will utilize.
%   * Your research questions or problems.

% The role of the introduction, like the abstract, is to orient your readers.
% This is best done clearly and succinctly.

The web is becoming increasingly more social as it's becoming more ordinary to
take part in some sort of web community. At the same time technological
advances and maturity have made it easy and cheap to create new communities.
This means that we're seeing an abundance of such communities appear.
They're all competing to establish self sufficient user bases, and if the
objective is to achieve large profits, to adopt as many users
as possible. This creates a strong incentive to come up with interesting new
features and best your competitors when it comes to pleasing your users.
As a result we're seeing rapid innovation in this area of the web infamously
coined ``Web 2.0''
\footnote{Web 2.0 was first used as the name of a conference arranged by
O'Reilly Media. The ``2.0'' part of the conference name was then used to
signify the revival of interest in the web after the dot-com bubble in the
early 21st century \citep{oreilly07}.
Later the founder of O'Reilly Media, Tim O'Reilly, defined
the term as the characteristics of the web services that survived the dot-com
bubble and the web services he deemed to be the best newcomers to the
field \citep{oreilly05}.}.

This thesis focuses on navigational problems and only those which are of a
social nature. Having efficient and easy to use navigation is clearly
essential for serving your users' interests. As the content on the web to a
higher degree than before are user generated it has become almost impossible
for the creators of a given web service to design sound navigation without
relying on their loyal users. Instead such structures have to be organically
grown by designing navigational schemes that harness the work your user base
is conducting as they use your service. This is the essence of social
navigation as the first definition of the term clearly and succinctly
captures:

\begin{quote}
``In social navigation, movement from one item to another is provoked as an
artifact of the activity of another or a group of others.'' \citep{dourish94} 
\end{quote}

\section{Motivation}

Social navigation is a well defined term within the academic
community and there have been a handful of studies on it's applicability in
context of the web. Most of this research took place in the early days of the
web--preceding our current area of Web 2.0. As described earlier the
growth we're seeing of web services with social aspects are bound to provide
for innovations in the space of navigation. It would therefore be interesting
to look at some of the state-of-the-art social web services and look at what
contributions they have made to the field of social navigation.

We are currently lacking information on how one can use social navigation
consciously in a web application design process.

\section{Objective}

By collecting examples of good navigational implementations in the wild,
analyzing them, and categorize them we hope to offer a structured view of the
field of social navigation. We offer this information in the way of a taxonomy
of useful social navigation techniques.

Using some of the techniques established in our initial research on how social
navigation is leveraged in real world applications we try to improve an
existing web service. More specifically we are prototyping possible
navigational improvements for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation's joint
TV, radio, and Internet project: \emph{Ur\o{}rt}--a service where artists upload
their demos and get valuable playtime on radio and TV if their products are
judged to be of sufficient quality. Our focus is on the projects
web community where users can interact in a social manner in addition to
uploading their songs.

Going in and making changes to an existing web services can be both an
daunting and time consuming task. First one have to establish a trustworthy
relationship with the creators of such a service so that they are certain
you're not introducing bugs in their precious software. Secondly, grasping the
code base, third party libraries and development tools of such a software
project demands a lot of upfront effort before any real development work can
begin. This goes against the prototypical process we intended to use while
improving Ur\o{}rt.

Even though we've had an ongoing dialog with the developers of Ur\o{}rt we
decided to create our prototype as a layer on top of their service. By using a
scripting extension for the open source
Firefox\footnote{Available at http://firefox.com}
web browser we were able to make changes and additions to the way Ur\o{}rt were
presented to users who were participating in our study. We were able to create
a back end for the additional data and behavior our new functionality required
with the frameworks and programming language we found to be most efficient in
a prototypical process. This resulted in a transparent experience for our end
users as long as they had taken the necessary steps to set up the browser
extension and our script.

With our technical solution in place we were able to test it in practice by
conducting ``some sort of usability study''(not decided). This leads to our
research question:

\section{Contributions}

Contributions from our research on social navigation is threefold:

\begin{description}
  \item[Informing navigational design] by giving a structured overview of
    various navigational schemes in use today.
  \item[Applicability of social navigation] by showing results from real
    users' usage of social navigation designs.
  \item[Transparent prototyping techniques] by highlighting experiences from
    making a shell of navigational designs on top of an existing web service.
\end{description}

\section{Outline}

Moving on from this introductory chapter we'll take a look at\ldots before we
finally conclude our research in the final chapter.

% As we are unaware of any established technique for
% conducting such a study on real world navigation systems we create our own
% method as we go--fine tuning it as we learn from our experiences.
