\chapter{Introduction}

% The point of the introduction is to answer: what is this thesis about?
% Explain this in four steps by:
%
%   * Why you have choosen this topic rather than any other. Examples:
%       - has been neglected
%       - much discussed but not properly and fully
%   * Why this topic interests you.
%   * The kind of research approach or academic disciple you will utilize.
%   * Your research questions or problems.
%
% The role of the introduction, like the abstract, is to orient your readers.
% This is best done clearly and succintly.
%
% This structure is frequently seen in other UiO thesises:
% 
%   * Motivation
%   * Objective
%   * Contributions
%   * Structure of Thesis
%
% Some also have a methodology section in the introduction instead of a
% seperate chapter:
% 
%   * Motivation
%   * Problem Statement
%   * Research Methodology
%   * Scope of Thesis
%   * Summary of Results
