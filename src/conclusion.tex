\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}

The results of the research which we have provided in this thesis can be
categorized into three venues:

\begin{enum}
  \item We have given a strucutred overview of the field of social navigation
    as seen both in academic literature and in some noticeable social web
    sites.
  \item We have provided details of how one can implement unobtrusive
    prototypes in established spaces and the feasibility of such a technical
    approach.
  \item We have contributed knowledge of how activity streams functions as
    a social navigation technique on the \urort{} web site.
\end{enum}

Based on these three venues we'll provide the most important lessons to take
away from our research before we discuss possible future work in these fields.

\subsection{Social navigation}

\subsection{Unobtrusive prototyping}

\subsection{Activity streams}

\section{Future Work}

% If we had time we would have conducted a laboratory study as well. This way
% we would not have problems with the technological seeding we've seen
% since only the most technical apt were able to complete the entire study.

% We would also have tested the prototypes over a longer time frame. Favorite
% usage numbers gave us unconclusive results. With a longer usage period there
% could be possible changes in how important favorites are.
