This chaper will include information in how data was collected. So far this
includes content inventory/analysis.

\section{Content Analysis}

The term \emph{content analysis} is most often used to signify a research
technique used in the social sciences.
\citet[p.~18]{krippendorff03} defines it as:
``a research technique for making replicable and valid
inferences from texts (or other meaningful matter) to the contexts of their
use''.

This is however not the use of the term we're concerned with here. We consult
content analysis as the more pragramtic practice conducted within the field of
\emph{information architecture}%
\sidenote{
  \citet[p.~4]{morville06} defines information architecture as:
  \begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
    \item the structural design of shared information environments,
    \item the combination of organization, labeling, search, and navigation
      systems within web sites and intranets,
    \item the art and science of shaping information products and experiences
      to support usability and findability, and
    \item an emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing
      principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape.
  \end{inparaenum}
}.
Content analysis is deployed as a technique by information architects for
helping them generate a sound and well structured web site architecture.
It consists of two phases:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item a collection of a representative sample of data and
  \item an analyses of this collected data
\end{inparaenum}
\citep[pp.~241--243]{morville06}.
A graphical content mapping can be included as an optional
intermediate phase between data inventory and analysis if one finds such
representations helpful for understanding a web site's structure.
In it's essence a content analysis should identify the various
relationships (or lack of correlation) between a web site's content items.

Instead of using content analysis as a means for improving on an existing
site's content architecture we'll be tailoring this technique to best help us
discover and understand social navigation patterns in infamous web sites which
are known to make good use of such navigational designs.
