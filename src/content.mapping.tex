\chapter{Content Mapping}

\label{appendix:content.mapping}

A map based approach inspired by Harry Beck's London Underground tube
map seen in Figure~\ref{figure:beck.1933.map}
(p.~\pageref{figure:beck.1933.map})
will be used for visualizing the navigational relationships between content
items. \citet{walsh07} introduced such visualization methods to the information
architecture field.

      The present Underground Tube map of London was introduced as early as
      1933 by graphic designer Harry Beck. It's merits are discussed
      in with regards to visual design by \citet{hadlaw03} and highlighted as
      a remarkable example of abstraction in relation to computing by
      \citet{kramer07}. Retrieved from the Transport for London web site:
