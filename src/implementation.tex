\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chapter:implementation}

This chapter should include design choices for my implementation. For example
choices taken for generating as much relevant data for test users as possible
and a computational sound method for doing so. As JavaScript in browsers are
quite inefficient it will probably be necessary to persist data at a server
in some sort of cache. The clients could then get this data by invoking a
single request. The result could for instance be JSON serialized. Scraping of
such data is probably done more efficient and safer at the server side since
multiple XMLHttpRequests in the clients for scraping and parsing could prove
to be quite computational expensive.
