Flickr is a photo sharing site which are known to be on the cutting edge when
it comes to enabling new and innovating features in its domain. Flickr has a
quite peculiar history as it started out as a massively multi player online
game. An environment for photo sharing within the game was added in 2004 which
quickly became more popular than the game itself. The focus of the company was
shifted and their new photo sharing community was bought by Yahoo! Inc. in
March 2005 \citep[\p{257}]{livingston07}.

This subsequent
analysis of Flickr will be carried out as a registered user. One has to be
registered for interacting with the site in such a way that one leaves
persistent traces. The site has a open nature enabling anonymous access
to the majority of content.

\subsection{Thumbnails}

Already on the welcome page (\figureref{scrsh.flickr.welcome})
we're finding navigation links that are social of
nature. Four thumbnails functions as sample of the most recently uploaded
photos by other members of the community. One can either navigate straight to
a detailed page for each particular photo by clicking on the respective
thumbnail (Id 6, p.~\pageref{table:flickr.content.inventory.6})
or the profile of the uploader by clicking on their user
name (Id 7, p.~\pageref{table:flickr.content.inventory.7}). Such thumbnails
with minimal meta data (the uploader) are prevalent all over Flickr. Of the
120 pages we collected in our content inventory 26 of them contained
thumbnails. Most of these thumbnails
are giving users incentives to navigate using social means%
\sidenote[-4\onelineskip]{
  Apart from the few pages that only show a
  stream of your own thumbnails when you're browsing your
  own photos by various methods.
}.
Which photos these thumbnails portray is dynamic. That is to say that other
users' actions\dash{}uploading a photo, tagging a photo, taking a photo with a
specific camera, collecting photos into sets, and adding photos to a certain
group\dash{}all determine the navigational choices you as a user is
presented with.

\subsection{Meta-data}

We arrive on a photo detail page as in
\figureref{scrsh.flickr.photo.detail}
if we utilize one of these thumbnails for navigation. In addition to comments
on the photo we find meta-data as in 
\figureref{scrsh.flickr.photo.detail.metadata}
Meta-data include the date the photo was taken, the manufacturer and the model
of the camera that was used which are all so called Exif%
\sidenote{Exchangeable Image File: a specification for image file format used
in digital cameras.}
data. Flickr utilize this data by enabling navigation based both on the
dates a picture was taken and by camera make and model. Say you're trying to
find a picture from your home town on a particularly beautiful summer day. By
using date of picture taking based navigation coupled with tags or
geographical data (which both will be discussed shortly) you're probably
increasing you chances of finding what you want. Camera make information could
be useful when looking at the quality of pictures taken with certain cameras
before purchasing one yourself.

\subsection{Folksonomy}
Of most importance
for Flickr, and indeed what makes Flickr a folksonomy, is its tagging
abilities. Caterina Fake, co-founder of Flickr, explains its importance as
\postquote[\p{261}]{livingston07}{%
  Tagging really revolutionized the way the product behaved}
All registered user can label anyone's photos by applying such short
descriptive tags. This collaborative process lay the ground work for other
user's ability to easily browse photos by topic.
\figureref{scrsh.flickr.tagcloud}
exemplifies how the user generated data trough tagging can be used as a
navigational aid. A so called \term{tag cloud} is used to visualize the
popularity (and thereby importance) of the individual tags. The larger the
tag title, the more frequent the tag has been applied to photographs.

Tag clustering was released in the fall of 2005 \citep{butterfield05} as a way
to easier see the relationships between separate tags. For any given tag a
cluster of three related tags is generated and displayed to users when they
are browsing as seen in
\figureref{scrsh.flickr.photo.detail}.
Flickr algorithmically generates these listings based on what tags users tend
to use together for labeling a photo.

Tagging is a very flexible approach only hindered by users' imagination. In
the early days of Flickr there was no support for geographical data. Users
soon found a remedy for this by tagging photos with longitude and latitude.
By using the same technology we're using in our prototype application
(Greasemonkey) they were able to integrate Google Maps%
\sidenote{
  Available at \url{http://maps.google.com}
} in Flickr, enabling user's to place their photos on a map and automatically
generate geographical coordinate tags%
\sidenote{
  More info about the early days of \term{geotagging} can be found on the
  remains of the Flickr Geotagging group, available at
  \url{flickr.com/groups/geotagging/}.
}.

\subsection{Geographical Data}

In late August 2006 Flickr introduced geotagging abilities
\citep{butterfield06} by integrating mapping aspects from Yahoo! Maps%
\sidenote{
  Available at \url{http://maps.yahoo.com}.
}
Users could now place their photos on a
map to signify where they were captured.

% Write and cite when proper geo data was incorporated.

\subsection{Interestingness}

\section{Facebook}
\label{section:analysis.facebook}

Facebook is a social network site that started as a service only available for
Harvard students in February of 2004. Within the same month Facebook was
opened up for students at several other universities in the
US. More universities and colleges were supported and Facebook opened up it
doors for high-school students in September of 2005 \citep{cassidy06}
before allowing global access for anyone\dash{}student or not\dash{}in
September of 2006 \citep{abram06}.
Facebook has seen an enormous growth and are today the largest social network
in some countries (see
\sectionref{background.sociality.the.social.web.social.network.sites}).

\subsection{Profiles}

As we've seen pictures and their thumbnails and titles are central in Flickr.
In the same way user names and thumbnails of profile images are scattered all
trough Facebook. This is no mystery as the dominant entity of Facebook is
people and their profiles much as pictures' essentialness for Flickr.

    \label{figure:scrsh.facebook.profile}
  \end{whole}
\end{figure}

\subsection{News Feed}
\label{section:analysis.facebook.news.feed}

The landing page when you log in to Facebook after having configured your
account is the \q{News Feed}. The news feed shows the recent activities your
friends have conducted. This eliminates the tedious process of checking every
profile page of your friends to keep on top of what they're up to.
The feed shows a list of items, each representing a type of activity. As
shown in \figureref{scrsh.facebook.news.feed}
these activities are distinguished by an
icon and presented chronologically. The data presented in the news feed are an
aggregation of every friend's \q{Mini-Feed} located on their profile.
as seen in\figureref{scrsh.facebook.profile}.

The news feed enables social navigation. All the navigational choices the feed
of representations of activity presents are constructed as a by-product of
other people's actions. When you select to attend an event, join a group,
post a photo, change your relationship settings, befriend a person, post a
comment on a wall or photo, or update your profile information your action
is added to the feed. The navigation presented by the feed
is therefore indirect and passive social navigation provided by implicit
feedback\dash{}providing no additional overhead for the advice provider.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Hyperlink Sharing}

Facebook have an interesting feature that makes hyperlink sharing easier for
it's users. When one are posting a comment on a the wall of a person, group,
or event one can provide a \abbr{URL}. By providing such a hyperlink to a
third party web page Facebook extracts an excerpt of the linked page with
optional graphics as seen in \figureref{scrsh.facebook.wall.link}. Since the
recipient of a message with a hyperlink can respond to the advice provider
we're witnessing active and direct social navigation.
