\chapter{Background}

% 1. how the literature was collected (describe it pragmatically)
%
% 2. literature review (summary, analysis, and comparisons)
%
%   A literature review should answer:
%
%     * What do we already know about the topic?
%     * What do you have to say critically about what is already known?
%     * Has anyone else done anything exactly the same?
%     * Has anyone else done anything that is related?
%     * Where does your work fit in with what is done before?
%     * Why is your research worth doing in the light of what has
%       already been done?
%
%   A literature review should be a dialodic rather than a mere
%   replication of other peoples writing. Should not be a laundry
%   list of previous studies.
%
%   Be focused and critical. Include an incisive critique that will help your
%   peers see the world differently.
%
% 3. introduction to terms as folksonomy, tagging, geotagging, etc
%
% 4. paragraph or two about my subject related to popular literature
%    (search Amazon or Library of Congress and say something like: there
%    were X books about this subject, the first was published in 2001
%    but the majority of books were published the last two years, and
%    maybe show a graph)

\subsection{Literature Search}

Before a literature search was conducted we did some preliminary thinking
about
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
  \item the focus of our topic to get more precise results,
  \item what literature databases would yield sufficient and accurate
    findings.
\end{inparaenum}
Based on these concerns we settled on the literature indexes layed out in
Table~\ref{table:flickr.content.inventory}
(p.~\pageref{table:flickr.content.inventory}).
