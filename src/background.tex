% 1. how the literature was collected (describe it pragmatically)
%
% 2. literature review (summary, analysis, and comparisons)
%
%   A literature review should answer:
%
%     * What do we already know about the topic?
%     * What do you have to say critically about what is already known?
%     * Has anyone else done anything exactly the same?
%     * Has anyone else done anything that is related?
%     * Where does your work fit in with what is done before?
%     * Why is your research worth doing in the light of what has
%       already been done?
%
%   A literature review should be a dialogic rather than a mere
%   replication of other peoples writing. Should not be a laundry
%   list of previous studies.
%
%   Be focused and critical. Include an incisive critique that will help your
%   peers see the world differently.

\section{Literature Search}

Before a literature search was conducted we did some preliminary thinking
about
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item the focus of our topic to get more precise results, and
  \item what literature databases would yield sufficient and accurate
    findings.
\end{inparaenum}
Based on these concerns we settled on the literature indexes laid out in
\tableref{literature.databases} and used the following keywords%
\sidenote{
  With varying use of modifiers (i.e. AND) or quotations to find exact phrases
}
for search:

\begin{description}
  \item[social navigation] is the concept of our main topic.
  \item[collaborative filtering] is often used to realize our main topic.
  \item[recommender system] can be an application of our main topic.
  \item[tagging] can be related to our topic depending on use.
\end{description}

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Literature Databases}

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In addition to keyword based search we also conducted citation searches on the
articles that in our opinion seemed to be the most important in the field.
The articles that we found relevant during our literature search phase was
collected and studied. During this process we eliminated articles by the same
authors where similar topics and implementations were discussed and focused on
either the most recent or the most representative article.

First we'll briefly discuss navigation and sociality both in general terms
and relating to the web. Then we'll concentrate on these two topics together
by looking at the research where social navigation is used
consciously as a concept. By this we mean the research where either social
navigation is defined, redefined or problems relating to the concept is
discussed with a basis in such definitions.
After our main survey of social navigation research we'll look at topics
which we believe can be included in the discussion of social navigation or are
closely related.

Some of the research that has been conducted in the space of
social navigation and related areas does not share our focus on the Web.
We still found much such research interesting in spite of their attention to
generalized problems or specific problems in other fields than the Web.

\section{Navigation}
% Try to cite some classic work. First navigation systems

Navigation was traditionally associated with controlling a weasel at sea to
a given destination.%
\sidenote{
  \emph{Navigate} is in fact derived from the two Latin words \emph{navis}
  meaning ``ship'' and \emph{agere} meaning ``to drive''.
  \citep[p.~756]{anderson97}
}
Since then it's been used to describe behavior related to safely finding ones
way whether one is driving a car, flying a plane or walking on foot. Maps
(a graphical representation of the medium one are navigating in)
and compass (a tool for connecting graphical maps to the physical world)
are often used as aids in this way finding. When used in context of
computer systems navigation is essentially a metaphor of our usage of the
word in our physical world. Trough computer systems we present users with a
conceptual space in which they can navigate \citep[p.~189]{whiteside85}.

\subsection{Navigation on the Web}

\citet{jones96} studied the navigational support provided by the Web's first
browsers:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item loading of page by entering it's location,
  \item loading a bookmarked page,
  \item loading a page by using a hyperlink on the current page,
  \item recall previously visited pages with forward and backward buttons,
  \item recall a previously visited page by locating it in a history list, and
  \item reloading the current page.
\end{inparaenum}
While modern web browsers support more forms of navigation%
\sidenote[-8\onelineskip]{
  These early browsers' history lists were not remembered between sessions. In
  addition we're seeing browsers as Flock (available at
  \url{http://flock.com}) with new methods of navigation integrated and also
  an abundance of plugins and extensions for the main stream browsers that
  enable new possibilities for navigation.
}
than the earliest applications we're not concerned with those here.
We're only interested in the navigation which are conducted within the main
browser window (where web pages are rendered) enabled by following hyperlinks.

nsectios{Sociality}

In the Oxford English Dictionary, second edition \citep[p.~905]{simpson89}
the adjective \emph{social} is defined as:

\begin{quote}
  Capable of being associated or united \emph{to} others.
\end{quote}

Discussion about explicit social matters is left for scholars of the social
sciences. We've therefore briefly introduced the term and are more concerned
with situations where it's related to computer systems, and most importantly:
the Web.

\subsection{Sociality on the Web}
% Discuss sociality on the web. Maybe a good place for a Web 2.0 discussion.

Sociality has become an integral part of our modern age version of the Web.
\citeauthor{bernerslee07}, seen by many as the inventor of the Web,
recently discussed the evolution from the Net (III: International
Information Infrastructure), trough the Web (WWW: World Wide Web),
to what he calls \emph{the Graph} (GGG: Giant Global Graph) in a
blog post \citeyearpar{bernerslee07}. The Graph is synonymous with the
\emph{Semantic Web}%
\sidenote{
  The Semantic Web is a web where data and information can be meaningful
  to computers and not just humans \citep{bernerslee01}. Although this idea
  was introduced by \citeauthor{bernerslee07} in 1994 it remains largely
  unrealized to this day \citep[p.~96]{shadbolt06}.
}
and he describe it in relation to
current trends of sociality on the Web:
\begin{quote}
  It's not the Social Network \emph{Sites} that are interesting--it is the
  Social Network itself. The Social Graph. \citep{bernerslee07}
\end{quote}

In other terms this means that social relationships on the Web have become so
important that they're more interesting themselves than the pages that
represents them. While it would be very interesting to look at how
\emph{social navigation} (to be discussed shortly) can be enabled between
different web pages and web services%
\sidenote{
  Examples of social navigation between different web sites can be seen in
  many of Facebook's (discussed in \sectionref{analysis.facebook}) third party
  applications, Google's similar \emph{OpenSocial} initiative (Available at:
  \url{http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/}), and various \emph{mashups}
  (to be discussed shortly) between open web services.
}, we're leaving it out of our research
due to the time constraints a master thesis inherits.

\section{Social Navigation}
\label{section:background.social.navigation}
Drawing on the previous explanation of navigation and definition of social, we
can combine the two terms. Social navigation then means going from one point
to another in a medium with other people.

Social navigation as a term was introduced in a short article by
\citet{dourish94} where they discussed three types of navigational mechanisms,
spatial, semantic, and social, which they argue can be separated even though
there is evidence of situations where the different mechanisms are combined.
In their description of the social type they coined the term
\emph{social navigation}:

\begin{quote}
  When navigable information systems are extended to support collaborative
  activity, a third model of navigation arises. This is \emph{social}
  navigation. In social navigation, movement from one item to another is
  provoked as an artifact of the activity of another or a group of others.
  \citep[p.~1]{dourish94}
\end{quote}

\citeauthor{dourish94} exemplifies two cases where neither location
(spatial) nor content (semantic) is used for exploration--the social model
is used on it's own. Based on these two experiences \citeauthor{dourish94}
argues that we possibly need to move away from spatial models of navigation
and rather focus on designing explicitly with semantic and social navigational
techniques.

A more throughout review of social navigation on the Web was introduced
by \citet{dieberger97}. He builds on the ideas introduced by
\citeauthor{dourish94} and looks at it from a more practical standpoint when
he describes navigational behavior on the Web in it's earlier days.

\citeauthor{dieberger97} highlights an important aspect for making interaction
on the Web smoother. With an ``awareness of the presence of
other users'' \citeyearpar[p.~812]{dieberger97} one can give an indication of
what parts of a web page that is of high demand and possibly identify the
users accessing them.

A summary of research on social navigation up to the beginning of this
millennium was written by \citet{dieberger00b}. The authors discuss social
navigation in more general terms while higlighting some implementations of
computer systems supporting social navigation. They contribute some quite
interesting details about social navigation.

\citeauthor{dieberger00b} include the properties of \emph{personalization}
and \emph{dynamism} into their understanding of what social navigation is.
Social navigation is not preplanned, but grown dynamically in an organic
fashion. This distinction is shown by the example of walking down a road in a
city versus walking on a forest trail. Personalization means that the
navigation advice is given to the receiver in a fashion that suits her.
Related to dynamism is social navigation's temporal nature.
\citeauthor{dieberger00b} shows this with the analogy of a forest trail
which will vanish if it's not used.


The most detailed definition of social navigation to our knowledge was
completed by \citet{svensson03} in his Ph.D. thesis. To understand his
definition we'll have to introduce his wording of the actors in a social
navigation process:

\begin{description}
  \item[Navigator] is ``the person seeking navigational advice''
    \citep[p.~20]{svensson03}.
  \item[Advice provider] is a ``person or artificial agent providing
    navigational advice to a navigator'' \citep[p.~20]{svensson03}.
\end{description}

Social navigation was then defined as:

\begin{quote}
  navigation that is conceptually understood as driven by the actions from one
  or more advice providers. \citep[p.~20]{svensson03}
\end{quote}

Firstly, \citeauthor{svensson03} talks about navigation with is ``conceptually
understood'' as driven by these advice providers. As long as the user believes
his navigational choices are driven by advice providers it is social
navigation. Secondly, the actions that the navigator is driven by need not be
only direct advice from a single advice provider, but can also be aggregated
of nature.

\subsection{Fundamental Categorization}

% discuss fundamental groupings of social navigation, explicit, implicit and
% so on
In his classic article \citet{dieberger97} distinguishes between an
\emph{active} and \emph{passive} form of social navigation. This distinction
is grounded in the nature of the exchange of information between the two
parties involved in a social navigation process: the advice
provider--the creator of navigation cues--and the navigator.

\begin{description}
  \item[Active] social navigation finds place when a person either
    deliberately seeks out another and asks for a navigation advice or
    intentionally gives away such navigational advice.
  \item[Passive] social navigation happens when people make available
    navigational aids that later can be used by other people.
\end{description}

\citeauthor{svnesson03} groups social navigation in \emph{direct}
and \emph{indirect} forms. They seem to be similar to
\citeauthor{dieberger97}'s categorization:

\begin{description}
  \item[Direct] social navigation is where ``communication between navigator
    and advice provider is mutual and two-way''
    \citep[p.~21]{svensson03}.
  \item[Indirect] social navigation occurs when ``communication between
    navigator and advice provider is non-mutual and in one direction''
    \citep[p.~21]{svensson03}.
\end{description}

% directly visible or aggreagated and hidden in the interaction history of a
% physical object or place dieberger00b

From these broader characteristics of social navigation we'll continue
with a discussion of several applications of social navigation found in
secondary literature.

\subsection{Application}

Social navigation have been applied in several different forms described in
academic litrature.

\subsubsection{Hyperlink Sharing}

\citet{dieberger97} is particularly concerned with making handling of
\emph{URL}%
\sidenote{
  Uniform Resource Locator. URL was formerly an abbreviation of Universal
  Resource Locator.
}
entities transparent for users in different tools related to web browsers and
the operating system itself. Making URLs invisible to users will in his
opinion enable more widespread use of social navigation trough pointer
sharing. Web browsers handles URLs embedded as hyperlinks
transparently so we're not going to elaborate on matters of URL handling in
auxiliary systems here.

Both \cite{dourish94} and \cite{dieberger97} observed social navigation on the
Web when hyperlinks were shared on web pages. Creators of these pages often
had a list of pointers to other web pages they deemed interesting enough to go
trough the trouble of creating such a listing. By doing this they created
an opportunity for navigation based on social factors.

% should this be in the analysis section?
While pointer pages still is in existence it seems that the increasing
use of blogs (see \tablepageref{blog.usage})
have resulted in a new form for sharing interesting web pages,
which often is other blogs. So called \emph{blogrolls} is a way for blog
authors to list other blogs they are reading regularly. They thereby function
``as a navigation tool for readers to find other authors with similar
interests'' \citep[p.~3]{marlow07}. An example of a blogroll can be seen in
\figureref{scrsh.dailykos.blogroll}.

}

A new phenomena appeared to the mainstream with the introduction of the
\emph{del.icio.us} social bookmarking system.
%cite, discuss further, lead in to next section.

As \citet[p.~806]{dieberger97} argues the Web's growth, even at it's modest
size of 1997 compared to it's staggering size over 10 years later, have
implications on how easily it is to locate information. By creating pointer
pages, and now socially shared bookmarking services, users are imposing a
structure on the web. By navigating these kinds of interlinked hyperlink
collections it could be that users are getting access to more related and
higher quality information. Sharing a hyperlink, either on you web page or
trough a bookmarking service, requires a conscious effort. One would believe
that people only choose to do so for information they find interesting.
