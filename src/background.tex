\chapter{Background}

% A litterature review should answer:
%
%   * What do we already know about the topic?
%   * What do you have to say critically about what is already known?
%   * Has anyone else done anything exactly the same?
%   * Has anyone else done anything that is related?
%   * Where does your work fit in with what is done before?
%   * Why is your research worth doing in the light of what has
%     already been done?
%
% A litterature review should be a dialodic rather than a mere replication of
% other peoples writing. Should not be a laundry list of previous studies.
%
% Be focused and critical. Include an incisive critique that will help your
% peers see the world differently.
