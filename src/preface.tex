\chapter{Preface}

Asbj\o{}rn F\o{}lstad at \abbr{SINTEF} was of great help in building the
research design used for our real world experiment.
He did also accept our work as part of the \abbr{RECORD} project where we
were able to obtain founding.
Morten Skogly at \abbr{NRK} \urort{} was helpful with providing information
about their web site and recruiting participants to our experiment.

Andreas Dieberger, Peter Brusilovsky, and Robert Mertens was helpful with
giving us permission to freely use illustrations from their
published articles.

Last but not least my supervisor, Gisle Hannemyr, deserves credit for
his guidance and thoughtful input during the whole master thesis process.
