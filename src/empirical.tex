\chapter{Empirical Study of a Social Navigation Prototype}
\label{chapter:empirical}

This chapter details an empirical study of the prototype implementation we
developed in \chapterref{implementation}. First we'll frame what we think this
study should answer trough research problems and hypotheses. Then we'll go on
to describe the method we used for conducting this study before the results of
the study are presented. Based on the results we'll discuss our findings
before we close this chapter with some words about the limitations of this
particular empirical study.

In this chapter we'll use the following symbols and abbreviations:

\begin{items}
  \item $N$: number of occurrences
  \item $Mdn$: median
  \item $Rng$: range
  \item $\sigma$: standard deviation
  \item $\overline{x}$: mean for $x$
  \item $U$: Mann-Whitney U-test statistic
  \item $T$: Smallest of the two sums of ranks for
    the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
  \item $Z$: standard score
  \item $p$: probability value
  \item $\sigma$: level of significance
\end{items}
