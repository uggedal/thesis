\chapter{Empirical Study of a Social Navigation Prototype}
\label{chapter:empirical}

\section{Research Problem}

\begin{quote}
  Can social navigation trough activity streams influence
  usage of an established web site?
\end{quote}

This question deals with how a specific social navigation technique, activity
streams, could potentially influence experiment participants' usage of a web
site. We also wanted to question how the experiment participants perceived
activity streams in relation to the quality of their usage experience:

\begin{quote}
  Can social navigation trough activity streams improve users' perceived
  quality of usage of an established web site?
\end{quote}

We also had a more technical research question relating to how one can
conduct experiments on established web sites, hoping to answer the previous
research questions:

\begin{quote}
  Can prototyping with Greasemonkey be used successfully
  for testing user behavior in an established web site without
  intruding on users not involved in the experiment?
\end{quote}

  \caption[Experiment Overview]{
    Overview of the various parts of the experiment. The population $n_1$
    are given a pretest. $n_2$ completes the prestest and half are given
    an treatment prototype while the other half is given a placebo
    prototype. After one of the two types of prototypes
    are provided, respondents are followed-up to check
    if they had problems installing the prototype software.
    $n_3$ successfully installed the prototype and are given a posttest.
    $n_4$ completes the posttest.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Activity streams as a social navigation technique}

\subsection{Transparent prototyping with Greasemonkey}

During our development of a prototype application with Greasemonkey for
enhancing an established web page we got a feel for its pros and cons from a
development perspective.

\subsubsection{Requires no access to the established implementation}

\subsubsection{Requires little knowledge of the established implementation}

\subsubsection{Requires more work than altering the established
  implementation}

\subsubsection{Fragile when the established implementation is changed}
% Only happened once during a two month span on \urort{}. What was scary
% thought was that the changes made the user script on the client side
% obsolete. If this had happened under production usage when the user scripts
% was pushed to the clients we would be in a world of trouble. Changes on the
% server side platform can be handled more transparently.

\subsubsection{Less performant than the established implementation}

\parabreak

When we conducted a study of our prototype with real world users
we got valuable feedback on how well such a system works for the average user.

\subsubsection{Limited in browser selection}

\subsubsection{Difficulties with installing Greasemonkey}

\subsubsection{Difficulties with installing user-scripts}
