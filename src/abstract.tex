\chapter{Abstract}

Social navigation usage on the Social Web were studied by conducting content
analyses to see how prevalent such navigation are now compared to the Web's
infancy. The common characteristic of the types of social navigation we found
in these sites were the reliance on peers for the information used in the
navigation process. We therefore built on existing definitions of social
navigation an provided our own definition emphasizing the essentialness of
peers in the web site one are navigating in.

We found activity streams\dash{}chronological listings of what
all the individuals one are particularly interested in have recently been
doing on a web site\dash{}to be an interesting and seemingly useful technique
of social navigation. A prototype of activity streams were built on top of the
\urort{} web site so that we could test the usefulness of such a social
navigation technique in a real world two-group experiment with a pre-post
setup. The results indicated positive results for activity streams, but were
inconclusive partly because of high non-accomplishment
rates and ambiguous results.
