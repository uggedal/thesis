\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}

This chapter will include a synthesis based on the analysis of our collected
data. The larger lines of our findings will be presented and we'll try to
represent a new and refreshed terminology for the field of social navigation
by the means of a taxonomy including patterns of navigational use.

\section{Social Navigation on the Social Web}

\subsection{No Explicit Design for Social Navigation}

It does not seem like the designers of social web pages design for social
navigation explicitly. There seem to be a trend for designing for social
interaction. An implicit by-product of such an approach seems to be
the creation of several forms of social navigation constructs.
We base this observation our studies of two large social web sites in
\chapterref{analysis} in addition to cursory observation on other social web
sites.

\subsection{Friendship, Group, and Content-Based Social Navigation}

% Possible themes could be a discussion of grouping of all social navigation
% as either friendship and group based or content based. A hypothesis needs to
% be established and we'll have to try falsify this claim based on our
% knowledge of the field after conducting both throughout analysis and more
% cursory analysis of several web pages.

It seems to us that further distinctions from those presented in
\sectionref{social.navigation.fundamental.categorization}
of different kinds of social navigation is in order. We have seen that social
navigation can either be based on:

\begin{items}
  \iterm{friends} you have a connection with,
  \iterm{groups} you belong to, or
  \iterm{content} that you seem to seek.
\end{items}

This means that you can get help to navigate against your goal based solely
on the fact that you know one person\dash{}he is a friend. Since you have a
connection to a friend his actions could potentially be interesting to you,
and can be harnessed for navigational aims. The actions of a total stranger
on the other hand would be far less interesting for navigational purposes.

A total stranger could be a member of the same group as yourself. If this
group for instance represents a common interest, the actions of this total
stranger could prove to be helpful when you're navigating. This relies on the
fact that you share an interest and his actions could be aligned with
the ones you would perform on your own.

Lastly content can be used for social navigation purposes. When you're looking
for a certain item, item with some of the same characteristics can be
interesting to you. Your not getting navigational advice from a friend, or
someone from a group you're a member of, but advice in your navigation solely
based on the content you're navigating towards.

\subsection{Social Navigation is Peer-Based}

An overlying theme of the forms of social navigation we found in the wild were
that it was created by equal peers. The construct for enabling the social
navigation are created by the web site creators. But the data that
enables navigational choices of a social nature are created by other users
like you\dash{}by the community.

\section{Transparent Prototyping with Greasemonkey}

\subsection{For Developers}

During our development of a prototype application with Greasemonkey for
enhancing an established web page we got a feel for its pros and cons from a
development perspective.

\subsubsection{Requires No Access to the Established Implementation}

\subsubsection{Requires Little Knowledge of the Established Implementation}

\subsubsection{Requires More Work than Altering the Established Implementation}

\subsubsection{Fragile when the Established Implementation is Changed}

\subsubsection{Less Performant than the Established Implementation}

\subsection{For Users}

When we conducted a study of our prototype application with real world users
we got valuable feedback on how well such a system works for the average user.


\subsubsection{Limited in Browser Selection}

\subsubsection{Difficulties with Installing Greasemonkey}

\subsubsection{Difficulties with Installing User-Scripts}
