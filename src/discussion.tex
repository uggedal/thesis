\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}

This chapter will include a synthesis based on the analysis of our collected
data. The larger lines of our findings will be presented and we'll try to
represent a new and refreshed terminology for the field of social navigation
by the means of a taxonomy including patterns of navigational use.

Possible themes could be a discussion of grouping of all social navigation as
either friendship and group based or content based. A hypothesis needs to be
established and we'll have to try falsify this claim based on our knowledge of
the field after conducting both troughout analysis and more cursory analysis
of several web pages.
