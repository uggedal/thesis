\section{Discussion}

This section will discuss our various research questions in relation
to the results we have presented. We'll start with looking at
several aspects of activity streams as a social navigation
mechanism before we discuss prototyping with Greasemonkey on
an established web site.

When presenting our results we worked with a level of significance
$\alpha$ of $p \leq 0.05$%
\sidenote{
  See \sectionref{empirical.method.data.analysis.level.of.significance}
  for details.
}
and handeled values of $p$ in a black and white fashion.
\prequote[\p{1277}]{rosnow89}{argues that}{%
  surely, God loves the .06 nearly as much as the .05}
We are therefore going to discuss results with values of $p$ approaching
$\alpha$ in a more flexible fashion in this section.

Based on our profiling of the respondents (see 
\tablepageref{respondents.profile.usage} for details)
we found the two groups which were using our implementation to be
representative of the general sample in all aspects except how
frequent they used \urort{}. The control group used \urort{} more
frequent than than both the general sample and the experiment group
with a probability of 0.055 compared to the general sample.
We argue that this makes the control group more experienced
\urort{} users than the experiment group.
This is an important aspect which we'll try to keep in mind in
the discussion about activity streams which follows.

\subsection{%
  Can social navigation trough activity streams help users keep
  up-to-date on favorites' activities on \urort{}?
}

We hypothesed that usage of activity streams would improve the level
of which participants could keep up-to-date on what their favorites
on \urort{} were doing.

\subsubsection{Activities in general}

Comparing how easy respondents felt it was to keep up-to-date on activities
within the experiment and control group%
\sidenote{
  See \tablepageref{uptodate.favorite.activities.within} for details.
}
we observed a higher increase in agreement for the experiment group. The
increase of agreement for the control group could be explained as
a placebo effect.
Since the probability of making a type I error are
$p = 0.086$ we simply take this result as an indication and not as hard proof
for validating our alternative hypothesis.

In addition the comparison within
groups we also compared the differences between the two groups. We observed
similar positive results for activity streams with $p$ approaching $\alpha$
with 0.089.
We take the higher increase of agreement for the experiment
group as an indication of the appropriateness of an activity stream for keeping
up to date on activities. We will not generalize these results to say that
activity streams are uniformally appropriate for keeping up-to-date on
favorites.

\subsubsection{Specific activities}

When asking participants to qualify more specific statements of how
easy they felt they could keep up-to-date on different types of activities
we observed differences between%
\sidenote{
  See
  \tablepageref{uptodate.favorite.specific.activities.between}
  for details.
}
the groups and within the groups%
\sidenote[2]{
  See
  \tablepageref{uptodate.favorite.specific.activities.within}
  for details.
}.
The between group data showed no significant nor borderline significant
differences between groups. This contradicts the borderline significant
results we found with the same comparison on activities in general.
When comparing within groups the only notable and significant difference
appeared for activities relating to publishing new blog posts.

Why do users of activity streams so strongly feel that the stream help them to
better keep up-to-date on recent blog posts and not the other types of
activities? One possible explanation could be that the activity stream
shows an excerpt of blog posts after the blog author and title.%
\sidenote{
  The activity stream with blog excerpts can be seen in
  \figurepageref{scrsh.urort.activity.stream}.
}
This means
that the user can get a glimpse into the content of the blog post without
actually navigating to the post itself.
But reviews from other users are also displayed with an excerpt of its
content. We therefore find this explanation to be highly suggestive.

Our data shows no indicators as why we experienced contradicting results
when asking how easy users could keep up-to date on activities in general
compared to specific activities. We note this as a potentially useful leason
when conducting questions about the ease of conducting a task. In our case
asking more generally gave larger differences than asking more specific
questions.

\subsubsection{Percieved usefulness}

\subsubsection{Percieved ease of use}

% ease of use a bad metric to compare the two versions
% as the placebo has fewer features and are therefore easier to use

\subsubsection{Acceptance as standard feature}



\subsection{%
  Does social navigation trough activity streams lead users to more often keep
  up-to-date on favorites' activities on \urort{}?
}

\subsubsection{Keeping up-to-date frequency}

\subsubsection{Prototype usage frequency}



\subsection{%
  Does social navigation trough activity streams lead users to make
  more artists on \urort{} their favorites?
}

\subsection{%
  Can navigational prototyping with Greasemonkey be considered a
  viable technical option when testing user behavior in an
  established web site?
}

When we conducted a study of our prototype with real world users
we got valuable streamback on how well such a system works for the average user.

\subsubsection{Limited in browser selection}

% Reference how many we had to send mail to and how many answered.
% Reference firefox usage for respondents to remove those respondents
% which did not actively use firefox from the above equation.

\subsubsection{Difficulties with installing Greasemonkey and user-scripts}

% reference non accomplish rates
% reference follow-up results (but take with a grain of salt)

\parabreak

During our development of a prototype application with Greasemonkey for
enhancing an established web page we got a feel for its pros and cons from a
development perspective.

\subsubsection{Requires no access to the established implementation}

\subsubsection{Requires little knowledge of the established implementation}

\subsubsection{Requires more work than altering the established
  implementation}

\subsubsection{Fragile when the established implementation is changed}
% Only happened once during a two month span on \urort{}. What was scary
% thought was that the changes made the user script on the client side
% obsolete. If this had happened under production usage when the user scripts
% was pushed to the clients we would be in a world of trouble. Changes on the
% server side platform can be handled more transparently.

\subsubsection{Less performant than the established implementation}

\section{Generalizability and Validity}

\subsection{Scale of experiment}

% small number of participants

\subsection{Selection of subjects}

% We were only concerned with Firefox users. These are probably
% not representative for Urørt users.

\subsection{Technical seeding}

% The installation process was somewhat complicated. This means
% that the most technically knowledgeable people are those
% which answered our posttests.

\subsection{Motive for participation}

% The people who want to participate in such an elaborate study is
% probably fairly interested in Urørt. They are experienced Urørt users
% and are therefore not representative of the Urørt population.

\subsection{Implications}

% This has consequences for the validity of our study. We can not generalize
% back to Urørt users in general.
