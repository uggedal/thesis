\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Asbj\o{}rn F\o{}lstad at \abbr{SINTEF} was of great help in building the
research design used for real world user testing and accepting our work as
part of the \abbr{RECORD} project where we were able to obtain founding.
Morten Skogly at \abbr{NRK},
urort{} was helpful with providing information about their web site and
recruiting users for testing our navigational prototype.

I'd like to thank
Andreas Dieberger,
Peter Brusilovsky, and

some of their published articles.

Last but not least I'd like to thank my supervisor, Gisle Hannemyr, for
his guidance and thoughtful input during the whole master thesis process.
